We are in the year of 2015, the Human Hive is still fueled by coal.
Planet Earth is coughing with a flu, called Global Warming.
Free agents are popping up everywhere trying to heal its cells.
Beings across the spectrum of life scarify themselves to ring the alarm
_"Something smells here”_.
**Will you respond?** - Maybe your nose got stuck too so you can’t smell.


### But what is this Human Hive anyway?

Imagine that you play a game.
You got to have rules, right?
How would you describe a flow of actions without any limitation?
You couldn’t really, but you can describe a game.
So there you have it.
You need to have limitations otherwise it wouldn't be a game.
Sometimes it's fun to play along the rules,
other times it is even more fun to brake them.

So there is this game they have called it 'Being a Human'.
You get a high-tech lather suit with 5 easily accessible sensors.
You can hear, touch, smell, taste and the coolest is that you can see.
As you play, you can get upgrades, but let’s leave that for later.
These senses bring you all sort of experiences.
You can really get high on them, so be warned.
You do get a fuzzy controller device with the suit and that’s called Brain.
You will be surprised by its capabilities.
When you put on the suit, it will totally feel real.
It is really something special.
I’ve heard that they had to build the gear with extremely short battery life
due to safety reasons.
Some of the first gamers got stuck inside it for quite a while out of excitement.
They are still on rehab insisting that they are limited.
The new suits, you need to recharge quite often,
but you can continue the game where you've left off.
A battery span is called a day in the game.
When the day is over the lights go out and the suit becomes increasingly heavier.
There is a lot more to it, but let's get on with the rules.

The idea is that you can experience a host of things except your own self.
However everything you experience teaches you something about who you are.
To put it simply it is the world of reflective illusions.
The goal, obviously, is to find yourself.
When completed you can still play, you turn into a free agent,
you can help other players progress or you can help to make the game better,
revise the rules, even design really intriguing landscapes.
It is a known secret that if you are really advanced
you might be called in for an interview at the headquarters of the game series.
I think most of their software geeks are ex gamers.
Man, I would love to tweak on the core of game's engine.
Pretty sure I will be called in whenever that becomes relevant.
There is this guy Jesus, must be one of the Team Leads by now,
he likes functional programming too.
I am not sure about his music taste though, he is too heavy metal for me.
Rumor has it that once he put on a suit while being drunk and
completed the game in less then 30 years.
Well, easy when your daddy is the designer.
Anyway, he kept the record for 2000 years.
Thing is that the game become mainstream and much have changed.
Some argue that he is still the real champ
because they think it's easier to complete the game now.
I don't have a strong opinion, there are many excellent players out there.
Right, you got lost at those numbers.
Sorry, I've forgot to give you a perspective of time.

Remember, what I told you about the batteries,
that they have to be recharged periodically.
Inside the game only change is permanent.
Everything in there is changing,
so the players at some point have agreed to keep count of their recharges.
1 year is approximatly 365 recharges.
Yes, even that varies from year to year.
I guess some beginners find this counting useful.
There are many subtle things you have to learn as you go,
the units of time is one of them.
You don't know what time is? Let me tell you, me neither.
My best guess is the very fact of counting itself.

Enough of the talk, let's give it a try.
There are really no good guide lines I could give you.
You just have to roll on your own and learn.
Go, experience and tell me how it went.
