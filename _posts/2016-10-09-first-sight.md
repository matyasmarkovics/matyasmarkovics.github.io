First I saw You, than we've touched  
You've gave me a long long hug  
One were followed by many  
Our bodies aligned in harmony

Tongues moved through the night  
having forgotten the passing time  
There was more then flesh and blood  
We've knew it, we just couldn't grasp

What happens when we meet  
We both unknowingly disappear  
There's not a You nor a me  
Only an indivisible joy to be
