_Love_ is the sharing of our happiness, not 
the investment we make into another person to make us happy.
-- What fail us are precisely our hopes and expectations, not _Love_.

We hope that someone is going to make us happy.
However, that is not possible, so our expectation is bound to fail
along with our relationship with that special someone.

We fall in _Love_ with someone when they remind us our ability to be happy,
but they don't _make_ us happy.
Our brain simply makes a short-circuit between happiness and the picture of that someone,
similarly to how salivating and Lemon is connected. ;)
