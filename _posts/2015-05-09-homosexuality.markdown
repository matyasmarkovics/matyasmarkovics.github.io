Homosexuality is a burst expression of a deep, deep
but strongly suppressed desire to love one's self experientially.
If you are not Homosexual you cannot be Heterosexual either.
Sexuality in essence is the expression of love through our bodily sensations.

The misbelief that love has a gender either
leads us to neglect the intimate relationship with our body _(men)_ or
brings us the frustration that we are incapable of sharing intimacy _(women)_.

It is **not** True that only _women_ can be beautiful.
It is **not** True that only _women_ can be intimate with their body.
It is **not** True that _men_ are heartless soldiers who take everything by force.

Heterosexuality cultivates the merger of diversities,
hence symbolises the motor of the Universe.
That is the reason it had become a widespread pattern throughout.
However, Heterosexuality does not exists in its own right.
It can only exists if it is allowed into Existence,
in other words: it is Loved.
Remember, Sexuality itself **is** the expression of Love through the body.
So, Love Loving its own expression is essentially Homosexuality.
What we call Heterosexuality is the same thing times two:
Love Loving a pair of its own expressions.
Thus Homosexuality is implicit in Heterosexuality.

If you cannot have an intimate relationship with your own body,
how would you be able to have an intimate relationship with another body?

Heard the clich√©: _"If you don't love Yourself, you can't love anyone"_ ?

Touch yourself and feel into the touch now.
Immerse in the excitement of your own body!
Drop the limiting concepts of your gender and actually experience
what's it like to have a body of a man _or a body of a woman_.
