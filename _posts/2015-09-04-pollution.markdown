### A beautiful interview of Eckhart Tolle

 > "Whatever Human Beings create externally is a reflection of their inner state.
 > So, we are polluting the planet simply because our inner-selves are polluted by
 > an enormous amount of negativity or continuous resistance." - Eckhart Tolle

These words make it crystal clear what am I to do here.

That engaging in worldly activities, to make it a better place,
is like vacuum-cleaning the garden instead of the living room.
I, as a Human Being, have no responsibilities other then the housekeeping of my mind.
I know that my mind is clear when I feel at peace and content with the present moment.
Than and only than can I channel Happiness into the world,
which is the much needed water for this planet to flourish.
