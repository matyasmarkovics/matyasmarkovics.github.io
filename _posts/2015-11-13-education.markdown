### Education is like the meet industry,

**but it's _Your_ flash and blood.**

Everyone has to eat, drink, take a shit at the same time
and of course progress at the same rate.

The ones who we cage are not Live-stock, They are our own Self and children.
It is the death row of passion, creativity and self-expression.

**The death of _Life_ itself!**

At the age of 3 you are sat down on a chair at the nursery
and you die in a similar one years later, _at home_ if you are lucky.

You learn by trying and you would only try something if it was interesting.
A child's interest towards a subject either come from within themselves
or from the hope for the feeling of being loved by their parents _or teachers_.
The first reason should be encouraged over the second one.

The seeming successes happen on the rare occasion
when that interest raise at the same point in time
that subject is being thought.
I'd bet that the plan of what is thought when,
lasts for decades and only revised once or twice per decade.

When the education system produces a success, we praise that child as a prodigy
and the rest of the class is left feeling unloved, rejected.
Every children is made of Love.
They all have to be reminded of that.
Not just the ones that conveniently fit the System.

Listen to your Child, go Organic or be vegetarian! :)
