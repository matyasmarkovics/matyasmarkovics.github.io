Last night, I was inspired by one of _Rupert Spira_'s videos.

# Being Knowingly Happy

_"Carpe diem"_ is quite right.  
You actually die each night.  
You dream of Haven or, of Hell.  
You deeply rest in peace as well.  
You wake up as a newborn child.  
You could almost start to cry.  
Days come and Lives pass.  
Centuries have gone by, yet  
You have remained the same,  
You have remained the same:  
**_Being_**  

There are hints everywhere.  
Ice, Water and steaming Air.  
Like Matter, Thought and being Aware.  
3 suits You can always wear.  
Should you get lost somewhere  
Find out which makes You happier.  
Assume that and rest in there,  
**_Knowingly_**  

Life meant to be a joyful play.  
Let beauty lead Your way.  
It shows You, who You truly are.  
It's a mirror of Your loving Heart.  
Filled with joy and compassion,  
Feeling intimate with all expression,  
Expanding out of the Earthly bubble,  
You are just truly indescribable  
**_Happiness_**
