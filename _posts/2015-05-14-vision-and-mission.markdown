It is not possible to determine what a company in reality is,
let alone where it is heading.
Even the best attempt is a mere speculation regardless whether it is backed by carefully mined and analysed data.

We have been consumers for so long.
Resources,
energy,
information we ate it all up.
It was necessary for our growth.
Sometimes we could have had better quality food,
but we have learnt to be graceful for whatever little was given and to appreciate when we were spoiled.
Now we are ready to express ourselves,
to release our own flavour into the Universe.

We are at the stage of our existence where the Universe is slowly waking up to or remembering its ability to create.
We are all blossoming or bringing fruit,
collectively contributing to the expansion of the Universe.

Any company enabling the habitants of the Universe to express themselves is bound to be successful.
In fact from the Universe's point of view all companies are successful,
as they all contribute to its expansion with experiences regardless of how the experience is perceived.
Taking success as a certificate of being right all the time is arrogant and ignorant.
Especially arrogant because success,
even in the traditional sense,
is never brought along by the individuals in the company,
rather the ones making use of its services or products.
Ignorant because right and wrong don't exist without a particular point of view and there is no consistent point of view in time.
Therefor there is little point in a company making statements about itself.

Stating what a company is,
limits the possibilities in which it can succeed.
A carefully designed Vision and Mission statement is a clear sign of insecurity.
If anything it should be playful and bold.
Big enough to make the Universe excited about the materialisation of it.
With that attitude the success is guaranteed.

The way to success for a company is to vibrate together with the Universe and bring along its associates,
its users into this vibration.
