### It is crucial to acquire a dynamic point of view.

One cannot engage with the world without being biased.
However acknowledging that there are other valid assumptions
of the current state of affairs opens up new angles of the present situation.

_I could Imagine that I always wear sunglasses._

In that case I would never ever experience true colors.
The color of the lenses of the sunglasses would bias my view of colors
and determine what I perceive vivid or dull.

At the same time if I had many many sunglasses all in different shades and colors.

I could switch them every now and than to perceive a slightly different tint of the world.

Depending of the frequency I change my sunglasses
I would become aware of how the colors change depending on the glasses I wear.
Eventually I would learn to concurrently perceive the color through
one of the sunglasses and imagine the color as if seen through the others.
 - This we call compassion in the realm of emotions.

When I can perceive through all my sunglasses at the same time,
much like the eyes of the fly,
my view point is a complete blur and that is much closer to the reality
then the shapes and colors seen through the individual sunglasses.

In this blurry view changes seem to smooth out there seems to be a lot less significant events.
I feel that I am at peace and all is good as it is, there is nothing to worry about.

### Sunglasslessness

Perhaps it is this deep sense of calmness that brings the hidden fear of _sunglasslessness_ to the surface.
The fear of disappearance.
When this fear is accepted the speed at which the sunglasses swap in front of our eyes slow down.
The glimpses of not being able to see will increase.
Our eyes get used to the bright light of the Sun.
Those are the eyes of _God_.

**It is the eyes that can see, not the sunglasses.**
