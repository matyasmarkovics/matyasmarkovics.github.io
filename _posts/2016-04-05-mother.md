Seek not and you shell find  
All that is, is made of divine  

There is no means to an end  
What happens let it happen  

Your goal is not where the path leads  
But in the rock on which you lay your feet  

She is there in all of us  
The Mother of playful Gods  

We all fed from her breast  
Her milk flows with every breath  

There is no us without her  
We are her milk steamed and stirred  

At least we think we are  
In fact, our Being is singular  

Our limitless experience is a proof of that  
How could One know another if they were separate  

Anyone who ever felt _'I love You'_ should know that  
It is our shared Being that makes Love so intimate
