> Violence and Resistance are brothers of twin  
womb of Control that they’re conceived within  
Fate planted their seed in a playful harmony  
for Freedom cannot be esteemed; only in Slavery  

Just as a Mother gives birth to a beautiful child  
she endures her body to painstakingly strive  
the Love for the newborn is stronger then any  
when the cord is cut; the labor becomes memory  

We accept to Fall before we take a step  
No baby starts to Walk without a failed attempt  
Once we stand up from the trip and Fall  
our unfolding journey Begins to dawn  

What’s ahead of us; we may not comprehend  
the fog of Fear by which our sight is shortened  
There is no Fear without a perceived End  
and there is no End for our seeing to deepen  

Endless prospectives and possibilities  
our readiness is measured in difficulties  
Pushed out of our comfort zone; we realise  
Our limitlessness has been demystified
